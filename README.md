# EWC project
Implementation of Elastic Weight Consolidation in a CNN for a 
Bioinformatics course

See [the report](report/) for more details.

The code is documented with docstrings. Use Python's built-in 
help(). For example:

```
    >>> from model import EWC_Network
    >>> help(EWC_Network)
```

Most of the magic happens in the [model.py](code/model.py) file.

There are also two (very similar) demos, one using a 
[fully connected NN](code/demo_nn.py) and one using a [CNN](code/demo_cnn.py).
